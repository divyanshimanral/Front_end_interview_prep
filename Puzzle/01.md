# "25 Horses and 5 Tracks" problem. It falls under the category of combinatorial optimization problems. The goal is to identify the three fastest horses among the 25 using a limited number of races on five tracks.

### Now, here are 10 more questions of a similar kind:

1. You have 100 horses and 10 tracks. Find the three fastest horses.
2. You have 12 marbles and a balance scale. One of the marbles is slightly heavier than the others. How can you find the heavier marble in only three weighings?
3. You have 8 identical balls, and one of them is slightly heavier. You have a balance scale. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the heavier ball?
4. You have 30 bottles of pills. One bottle contains poison, and it takes one hour for the poison to work. You have 24 hours to determine which bottle contains the poison. How can you do it with just two people?
5. You have 9 identical-looking balls, and one is slightly heavier. You have a balance scale. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to find the heavier ball?
6. You have a 3-gallon jug and a 5-gallon jug. How can you measure exactly 4 gallons of water using only these two jugs?
7. You have 12 coins, and one is counterfeit (either heavier or lighter). You have a balance scale. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to find the counterfeit coin?
8. You have 8 bags of gold coins, and one bag contains counterfeit coins. You know that the counterfeit coins are lighter. How can you find the bag with counterfeit coins with only one weighing?
9. You have a standard deck of 52 playing cards and a balance scale. How can you find the heaviest card in the deck with only one weighing?
10. You have a box of chocolates, and you want to find the one filled with a caramel center. You can't see inside the chocolates. What is the minimum number of chocolates you need to sample to find the caramel-filled one?
