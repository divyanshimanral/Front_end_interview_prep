# Agile model / Agile methodology / Agile process

1. It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach
2. Agile is an Iterative and Incremental process.

## Agile Principles

1. Customer no need to wait for long time.
2. We develop, test and release peice of software to the customer with few number of features.
3. We can accept/accomodate requirement changes.

There will be a good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developer and Testing

### Advantages

Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of devlopment (or) We can accomodate Requirement changes in the middle of development

- Releases will be very fast(weekly)
- Customer no need to wait for long time.
- Good communication between the team.
- It is very easy model to adopt.

### Disadvantages

Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver softwate very faster.

# Scrum (v.imp)

Scrum is a frameworl through which we build software product by following Agile Principles.

**Scrum Team**

- Scrum incluedes group of people called as Scrum team. Normally contains 5-9 members

1. Product Owner
2. Scrum Master
3. Dev Team
4. QA Team

**_Product Owner:_**

- Define the features of the product
- Prioritize features according to market value
- Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
- Accept or reject work result

**_Scrum Master:_** The main role is faciliating and driving the agile process.

**_Developers and QA:_** Develop and Test the software

### Scrum Terminology

- User Story : A feature/module in a software

- Epic : Collection of user stories.

- Product Backlog : Contains list of user stories. Prepared by product owner.

- Sprint/Iteration : Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.

- Sprint planning meeting : Meeting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.

- Sprint backlog : List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

- Scrum Meeting : Meeting conducted by Scrum Master everyday 15 mins/day. Called as scrum call/ Standup meeting.

  - Questions asked in scrum meetings
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What will you do today?
    - Are there any impediments in your way?

- Sprint retrospective meeting : conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team, including both the ScrumMaster and the product owner should participate.
- Story point : Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA in th form of fibonacci series

        0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13.......
        1 story point = 1 hour/ 1 day (6 hours)
        Login ----> Dev-5 QA-3 = 8 hours / 1 Day

- BurnDown chart : Shows how much work remaining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.
