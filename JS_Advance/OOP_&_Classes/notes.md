# Does Javascript has classes?
Yes, javascript does have classes. This feature was introduced in ES6. However, it's important to note that Javascript is primarily a prototype-based language, and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritancce mechanisms. In other words it provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages such as Java or C++, but under the hood it works somewhat differently.
